# PyukuBot
A telegram bot that can do stuff...

It can do all sorts of random things. 

Add it to your telegram group chat and some of the features will definitely brighten up your chatting experience.

# Getting Started
## Dependencies
From the main directory start the pipenv shell.
```
pipenv shell
```

Once in the shell, install dependencies.
```
pipenv install
```

## Environment
Create `.env` file and set contents as following:
```
BOT_TOKEN= //your token goes here 
```

## Run

From the `PyukuBot/src` directory
```
pipenv run python3 run.py
```

# Contributing
You can contribute to the pyuku bot in multiple ways. Generally, any sort of feature supported by a new command is very much pleased. 


## Adding a new command

Adding a new command is made very simple. Only very basic python knowledge is required.

All you need to do is to create a file with the `main` function in there that returns a string and that's it.
The decorators will take care of all the bot logic and you won't need to ever touch these.


If you want to add a new command for the bot to support, add a new `nameofyourcommand.py` file in `/src/commands` directory.

The format of the command file.

 - The file MUST contain a `main` function that takes in parameters depending on the chosen decorator, and returns a `string`

 - The `main` function MUST use one of the predefined decorators. See next section on what decorators are available.

 - The file MUST contain a `description` variable declared at the outer most scope, that has a short description of the command. 

An example of the command file:

```python
# hello.py
from decorators import static_command

description = "replies with a hello message."

@static_command
def main():
    return "Hi! I'm Pyuku!"

```

 - `description` is needed for the command to be added into the `/help` command.
 - `main` is where you code goes. You are free to create other methods and classes in the file if so needed.


# Decorators

As mentioned in the previous section, pyuku bot is using decorators to hide all the bot logic used.

If you are not familiar with decorators it's not a problem, each decorator will be explained in this section so you can just straight up use it.

List of available decorators:

 - `@static_command` - use this decorator if your function doesn't require any input. Best suite for any simple random generator.
 ```python
 from decorators import static_command
 
 description = "your description goes here"
 
 @static_command
 def main():
	 text = ""
	 # code goes here
	 
	 return text
 
 
 ```

 - `@named_static_command` - use this decorator if you want to include sender's name in the message. `main` function will then need to take the name as a parameter.
 ```python
 from decorators import named_static_command
 
 description = "your description goes here"
 
 @named_static_command
 def main(name):
	 text = f"{name}" # user's name will be passed as a parameter
	 # code goes here
	 
	 return text
 
 ```
